# MOWZE GenAI Database Chatbot

MOWZE is an innovative project created during **HackYeah 2023**. The goal was to build a chatbot that **revolutionizes database interactions**. Instead of writing SQL, users can ask questions in natural language and let the bot generate the necessary SQL queries. This approach **simplifies data exploration** and makes it easier to gather insights from your database.
